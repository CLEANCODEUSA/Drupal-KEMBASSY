This is an Example Websockets module. It is in development

The module currently provides the following functionality:

1. Enable / Disable should work without errors

2. Module provides two Chat Blocks: After enabling the module as a site administrator, go to following path: '/admin/structure/block',
   click the 'Place block' button to place each of the available 2 Chat Blocks on different web pages across the site.  After placing the chat blocks in a region/page, open two separate browser tabs for each web page containing a Chat block. Enter a message into the text_area provided and click send. You should see the Chat message appear in Chat Block 2 and vice versa. This simulates Chat functionality using Websockets in Drupal.
